With this unofficial program you can view information about the weather at the ESCM airport.
Maybe you will be able to see other airports' weather information in the future. The weather will automatically be update as soon as there is a new METAR available.

***Only*** Linux and Windows support at the moment.  An Android version of the app is in the works. 

## How to get started: 

Download the file and run it. Done!
